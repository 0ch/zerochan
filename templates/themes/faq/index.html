                <p> It is standard vichan post formatting. </p>
                <p> '''text''' makes it bold  </p>
                <p> ''text'' makes it italic  </p>
                <p> **text** makes it spoiler  </p>
                <p> [spoiler]text [/spoiler] makes it spoiler  </p>
                <p> [code]text [/code] makes it code  </p>

                </h2>
                <p>See https://lainchan.org/q/res/11853.html#11853 </p>
                
                <p>Like all questions the answer depends on who you ask.</p>
                <p>My answer:</p>
                <p>First what lainchan.org is:</p>
                <p>lainchan.org is a domain name, the host that domain name points to  hosts an imageboard called lainchan based on vichan, it hosts a Mumble server, it hosts an audio stream.</p>
                <p>The purpose of lainchan.org the domain name is so you don't have to type an IP address to access the services hosted on the previously mentioned host.</p>
                <p>The purpose of lainchan.org is to be a place / community where people can interact online.</p>
                <p>What makes lainchan.org community different from all the other places / communities where people can interact online ?</p>
                <p>This is another good question, and one you haven't asked yet, but I will try to answer anyhow.</p>
                <p>Our main distinguishing factors are related to our appreciation of Lain and Serial Experiments Lain. </p>
                <p>The series is influenced by themes such as reality, identity, and communication, and it demonstrates them by using philosophy, computer history, cyberpunk literature, and conspiracy theory. (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)</p>
                <p>Most of the boards on the image board reflect aspects or influences of the series.</p>
                <p>Because the series is influenced by cyberpunk literature, it very easy to label the lainchan.org community as just a cyberpunk image board, but I believe that label is incomplete at best and a restriction at worst.</p>
                <p>My answer isn't the only answer, and I happy to see others posting their answer to the same question.</p>
                <p>My question to you which you don't need to answer here.</p>
                <p>The lainchan community is to you what you want it to be. What do you want it to be ?</p>

				   Why are my posts being changed  / language enhanced ?  
                </h2>
                <p> Lainchan has a language enhancer. It makes your posts more interesting and less like soykaf. </p>
				<h2 id="7">
				   \\|/|-|`/ !5 3\\/3|2`/ 14!|\\|0|\\| |\\|0+ 4 133+ |-|4%%0|2 1!|(3 |\\/|3 ? Why are other lainons not as Leet as me ?  
                </h2>
                <p>Lainons are Lainons, being the same would be boring. Different lainons have different backgrounds and skillsets. Don't give up on lainons before getting to know them. </p>
				<h2 id="8">
				   When I post without a name, I get given a random name ?  
                </h2>
                <p> Lainchan has random anonymous names generated, when no name is provided. </p>
				<h2 id="9">
                    Where did /insertboardnamehere/ board go ?   Where is /cyb/ ? 
                </h2>
                <p>This depends on the board. Some boards have been deleted, others are not present in the top bar (hidden), and others are locked, either as a read only archive or in dormant sleep mode. /cyb/ is locked and not in the top bar. It hasn't been deleted, all the old posts are still there. But it won't unlocked until Lainons can agree cyberpunk or cyb means, in order to prevent /cult2/ or /r2/  </p>

				<h2 id="11">
                    Where did my post go ?
                </h2>
                <p>Either you never posted it, or it felt off the board due to old age, or it was deleted by you or by Lainchan staff as a moderation action, typically for breaking the rules.  </p>
				<h2 id="12">
                    Lainchan is lame. insertnamechan is better.
                </h2>
